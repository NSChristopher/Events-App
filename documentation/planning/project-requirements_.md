## 3. Project Overview  
VividEvents is a visually dynamic events app where users can create, discover, and join events in their community. With a vibrant color palette, playful animations, and floating objects, the app aims to transform managing and attending events into a fun, engaging experience for everyone.

## 4. Problem Statement  
Organizing and discovering local events can feel dull and impersonal, especially on platforms with uninspired, utilitarian design. VividEvents targets young, social, and creative users who want event planning and discovery to be as lively and memorable as the events themselves. The app solves the problem of monotonous event management apps by offering a delightful, energetic, and social experience.
